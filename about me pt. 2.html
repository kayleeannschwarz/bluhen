            <p>i buy my oils strictly from youngliving and revive. the composition of oils is what makes them effective, including the soil in which they grow and the length the plant is distilled for. in order for a product to be considered organic, it must be planted on ground that is free of chemicals for only three years. youngliving ensures that the land is at least 50 years clean. they have a seed to seal gaurentee, which measures the quality of their oils. between distillation time, lack of regulation and loopholes, only a rare amount of oils are actually effective. if you don't believe in essential oils, chances are you're using peppermint from tjmaxx and not receiving a 100% pure and natural essential oil. research matters when choosing what oils are best for you!</p>
            
            <p>i use oils 3 ways: topically, aromatically and internally 
                <br>oils support every part and system of your body and each can have different effects.
                <br>what follow is how i use oils on the daily and why!

        <h3>diffusing</h3> 
            <p>when you use top quality oils, cheap diffusers may sometimes melt or change the composition of the oil. making an investment in a well-made diffuser is! worth! it! i have a diffuser from youngliving, which is worth the investment to ensure that your top quality oils are being diffused in a top quality way.</p>
            <p>the benefit of diffusing is not only an increase in air quality, but many benefits related to the oil as well. the smell of oils impact your limbic system which triggers memories related to the scent, allowing for some of the same benefits as applying an oil topically. because oils are so concentrated, they can be added right to water and diffused. below are some oils and combinations i love! (i use 3-4 drops of each oil)</p>

        <h3>ingestion</h3> 
            <p>young living has a certain line of oils that are actually fda compliant for ingestion called "vitality". not all oils can be ingested, but many can be if used correctly. here's a couple i choose to ingest and why!</p>

    <img src="img/lemon.png" width="375" height="300" alt="about" align="left">
        <br>
        <h3>lemon</h3> 
            <p>i love the lemon essential oil. not only do i use it in all my cleaning products, i also put a few drops of it in my water every morning. it has antioxidant properties and helps to detox the body. instead of utilizing lemon slices, without knowledge of where they were grown or how they were treated, i love that i can reach for lemon oil!</p>
        
 
    <img src="img/lime.png" width="375" height="300" alt="about" align="left">
        <br>
        <h3>lime</h3> 
            <p>diffusing lime has its own benefits but the lime vitality oil is always fun to keep on hand to be ingested! to be used just like fresh lime, i like to add a drop or two to homemade guacamole, margaritas or any other dish missing the lime flavor.</p>
            <br><br>
        
    <img src="img/orange.png" width="375" height="300" alt="about" align="left">
        <br>
        <h3>orange</h3> 
            <p>while i swear by lemon in my water, i've enjoyed mixing it up some days and using orange oil in my water to detox instead. orange is also nice to mix into cooking, but i love it the most for a natural way to whiten my teeth! i'll rub a drop or two across my teeth occasionally to keep them fresh and white.</p>
            <br>
        
    <img src="img/thievesv.png" width="375" height="300" alt="about" align="left">
        <br>
        <h3>thieves</h3> 
            <p>this oil seems to find its way into every product i use and i love it! it's great for fighting against sickness by supporting the immune system and i find myself reaching for it for any sick feeling that passes by. a drop pushed against the roof of my mouth or in tea always helps, but i also have the thieves mouth wash which has healed many a sore throat!</p>
