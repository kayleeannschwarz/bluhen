              toxic items in our homes hide chemicals that society has accepted as a normal part of products. with this normalization, the effect these chemicals have on our health is hidden. in order to start making the switch to non-toxic living, it's important to understand some of the main chemicals in our day-to-day products and how they effect us. 
              <br><br>
              the first ingredient to recognize often shows up on the back of a label as "fragrance." the ingredient "fragrance" has become a loophole in regulations, which allows companies to label anything that helps with scent "fragrance". this means that untested chemicals can be masked, allowing for up to hundreds of chemicals to be hidden by a single word. synthetic frangrance can cause allergic reactions, disruptions to natural hormones, respiratory triggers, migraines and so much more. right off the bat, avoid any product that has "fragrance" listed as an ingredient. 
              
              let's talk about other popular ingredients in products: 
              <br><br>
              1. parabens: known to disrupt the endocrine system, compromising hormones, the thyroid, reproduction and metabolism health and more
              <br>
              2. sodium lauryl sulfate (sls): what makes products foam, known to cause skin irritation
              <br>
              3. teflon: a non-stick coating found on kitchen items, can cause a variety of health conditions
              <br><br>
              other words to avoid: aluminium, pesticides, gmo's, triclosan, formaldehyde and hydroquinone

          <h3>why is this important?</h3>
          <p> you hear that these ingredients are bad for you, and that the product industry is corrupted. but why is it important to recognize this and make a change? first off, our skin is the biggest organ. what we surround ourselves with is what our body becomes. many ingredients that make up products are unregulated, and therefore can cause a variety of issues. by creating a healthier home and space for ourselves, many have found that long lasting health issues disappear and overall quality of life is improved. </p>

          <h3>beware greenwashing!</h3>
          <p>falling for greenwashing is the biggest mistake one makes when transitioning to non-toxic living. greenwashing is when a brand claims that their products are clean, natural or environmentally friendly when in reality they are not. they mislead consumers by labeling certain items as green, when their sourcing and ingredients say otherwise. this transitions into buying clean products, as many companies now claim that their products are organic and clean when they are not, tricking people into buying the products. in order to avoid the greenwashing by many popular brands, it's important to read the ingredients on the back of products to determine if they truly are toxic-free. </p>

        <p>the number one things i can say is don't trust everything you read. misinformation runs rampant, especially when it comes to clean living, so it's always important to double check your sources. don't just believe me, read about the topic for yourself, make choices that are right for you and find empowerment in learning the information for yourself. i encourage constant learning and growth as you step into this process!</p>
