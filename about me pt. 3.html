    <p>the way i start my day determines how my day goes, and i'm sure you can relate. so starting it off right with non-toxic products is where i begin! like i mentioned before, a majority of my products are essential oil based. some products i buy from youngliving, others i make myself. the best thing about oils is that they're highly concentrated, so each product i use is heavily diluted and lasts me a long time.</p>

    <h3>let's talk hair care.</h3>
        <p>i use young living's shampoo & conditioner, both of which are diluted with water. in between wash days, i use homemade dry shampoo. recipe: 1/4 cup cornstarch, 1 tbsp baking soda, 2 drops tea tree oil and 2 drops lavender. add a few tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder for dark hair! apply to hair with a makeup brush.</p>

    <br>
    <h3>prioritize yo face!</h3>
        <p>i wash my face with a charcoal bar morning and night. if i've been wearing makeup, i use coconut oil to wipe it off!
        a couple times a week, i'll use a homemade toner (witch hazel, apple cider vinegar + oils) to deep clean my face. for acne treatment, i'll put a spot of tea tree oil on breakout points.</p>  
        <br>

    <h3>glow baby glow</h3>
        <p>my all time favorite product i use is glow serum. my face moisturizer and saving grace, not only has it changed my skin, but i also get to absorb the health benefits of the oils morning and night! each ingredient is personalized to my skin, check out what i include and why!</p><br>

    <h3>your choice of deodorant is important!</h3>
        <p>another big switch i made was to non-toxic deodorant. deodorant often contains metals and aluminum that are extremely bad for our health. i made the switch to non-toxic deodorant a couple years ago, and is what i swear by changing if it's the only thing you do. i've tried a laundry list of them, here's the one i use now!</p>
    
    <p>the one thing i have left to switch is makeup. non-toxic makeup can be pricier, and i wanted to finish up what i already owned, so i'm just now getting around to making the switch. i asked for makeup for christmas, so am hoping to be satisfied with all my products come 2021! i ordered from iliabeauty.com and w3llpeople.com but choose what's best for you and your budget!</p></div>

        <h3>lotion</h3>
            <p>i have naturally prone dry skin, so keeping my skin hydrated is necessary for me. instead of using a store bought lotion with chemicals and fragrance, i opt to make my own. 
        <br><br>
            recipe: melt 2 cups coconut oil then pour into storage jar. stir in your choice of essential oils then let harden at room temperature. for my scent/benefits, i add 10 drops lavender and 10 drops stress away!</p>

        <h3>room spray</h3>
            <p>since i no longer use candles or synthetic scents, i'll use a room spray to freshen up my room! my room spray has a spicy smell to it, which neutralizes smells as well as purifies the air. 
        <br><br>
            recipe: in a spray bottle, add 1 tbsp witch hazel and top off with water. witch hazel helps the oil and water to combine! to create your scent, choose your essential oils. my choices: 15 drops orange oil and 15 drops thieves. </p>

        <h3>laundry detergent</h3>
            <p>i use the thieves detergent from youngliving. it comes super concentrated so it lasts for a long time! skin irritation from normal detergents was a problem for me, so i love that i can wash my clothes with clean products and still have them smell fresh and clean!
        <br><br>
            recipe: mix 1/3 of bottle with an equal amount of water, add three caps thieves household cleaner and 20 drops of lemon essential oil. use 1/4 cap - 1/2 cap depending on load size!</p>

            <p>while my detergent cleans well, i like to use a homemade stain remover for tough stains. i use a sponge to scrub the paste onto stains then let sit before throwing into the wash. i love that i never have to use harsh chemicals like bleach or ever worry about my clothes getting messed up!
        <br><br>
            recipe: combine equal parts thieves cleaner and baking soda, until a paste appears. add 20 drops lemon essential oil for extra purification. </p>

        <h3>kombucha vs. soda</h3>
            <p>i love carbonation, and therefore went through a kick where i would drink soda everyday. now, i opt for a glass of kombucha every morning, which curbs my cravings and allows for consumption of probiotics and antioxidants.</p>

            <p>when i switched to using oils to support my systems and productivity,  i realized i no longer wanted to rely on coffee for caffeine. if i need a burst of energy, i now reach for peppermint oil or if i need help with productivity, i turn my diffuser on. if you're craving a boost, opt for a natural tea instead!</p>

        <h3>probiotics</h3>
            <p>to better support my body, i take probiotics morning and night. often our body is lacking basic supplementation, causing a variety of physical and mental issues. here are some probiotics i recommend/take! </p>
                <ul align="left">
                    <li>- b12 daily to help with energy levels</li>
                    <li>- vitamin d for calcium and to balance sleep levels</li>
                    <li>- magnesium for a variety of health benefits!</li>
                    <li>- ashwagandha, relora and l-theanine to help stress levels</li> 
                    <li>- tumeric to help with joint and brain health</li> 
                </ul>
            <p>each person's body is different and therefore requires different things. talk to your health care provider about what supplements are best for you! </p>

        <h3>buy organic</h3>
            <p>for the longest time, i "ate healthy" but never bought organic. organic always ran pricier and never seemed worth it. eventually i realized that buying organic often eliminates pesticides and synthetic chemicals and increases the amount of nutrients in the food. work organic food prices into your budget and set it as an expectation, not an option.</p>
